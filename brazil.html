    <p> She lives in Sao Paulo, Brazil and was one of the first people that made me gain a new perspective. I stayed in her house with her family for a month and vice versa, everyone was traveling with each other and it was awesome. She is the most bright, vivacious person I have ever known and her influence on me will always be withstanding.</p><p>Now she goes to Florida State University after her family moved from Brazil to Florida and got a greencard there. She literally became one of my first best friends and I will never forget her.</p>

    <h3>Two Feet and a Heartbeat</h3>
    <p>After my trip to Brazil, I was excited to travel with my friends again and registered for a program in Ottawa, Canada. I traveled with 4 other Indonesians and spent the month without phones, wifi and just a campsite in the suburbs of Canada.</p>
